# HarvardXCS50WebCoursework
Dump file for code generated from the course

This repository will hold all the code I generate, good and bad, from the HarvardX CS50 Web and CS50 courses both hosted on EdX.

THIS FOLDER IS NOT THE FOLDER IN WHICH SUBMITTED COURSEWORK TO VALIDATE THE COURSE WILL BE HELD.
